# CODING TEST SUCKS!!!

This repo keeps track of solutions to coding challenge problems that I worked on for practice for over 2 months.
A Facebook recruiter talked me into this effort as he knew that people in my generation are not well-prepared for 
coding challenge despite of his hiring manager interests in my past professional experience. According to him, even 
a director position at Facebook requires coding challenge as the first step.

I know coding test sucks and favors people who just graduates from school, yet most companies are requiring it as a 
measure of skills nowadays. Some even religiously believe coding test will help them recruit the best candidates. 
People who were graduating from school prior to 2010, like I am, may find coding tests as their career killer, 
as they were trained not to memorize, but to be able to perform research on demand and to innovate. 

I think the coding challenge culture initially applied by big tech companies for recruiting graduates 
from University, which I think makes complete sense as students spends day-in and day-out to do tests or practice 
coding tests as part of their education. Also, they have no work experience for discussing in the interview.
However, it does not make any senses to challenge people who has a long line of experience in the career to with
school stuff. Tests are a distant memory for these people. It is apparent that the hiring manager or whoever
must have interests a candidate's work experience in order to schedule an interview. So, why not addressing 
the candidate's work experience in the interview as normally done before? Why is it necessary to force candidates to 
go through this coding challenge "ritual"?

Despite of my 2-month effort to practice all these tests on LEETCODE, etc. I only managed to remember a few of them. 
I was just overwhelmed by the sheer number of coding challenges on LEETCODE. There are thousands of them in existence
and counting. They are all new to me. There are new inventions on coding challenge every day with new tricks to elude 
people of their chance of employment. So, no matter how long you spend on training yourselves, it is only a matter 
of luck, not your skills. 

Nevertheless, I did not pass the coding challenge at Facebook despite of 2-3 months self-training. My coding challenge 
with Facebook was only partially successful. (They asked two coding problems in 40 min, I can do only one of them, 
the other one I was able to figure out the solution, but not having enough time to finish it). To be fair, the recruiter
gave me a second chance, but again, I can only manage the get it done partially, with brute force solution instead of 
optimized one.

A short time later, I got contacted by a Google recruiter, but again, the recruiter cant help but forcing me to go 
through the coding challenge, because it was the "company hiring policy", she explained. Being nice, I accepted the 
challenge, and again, I can only complete the challenge partially. 

It is noted that they all expect candidates to perform the coding tests without a hiccup and with an optimized solution. 
Even if you come up with a solution, but not the optimized one or struggling to finish it, you failed. To be able
to come up with an optimized solution, you must be able to deeply understand the problem to figure out how to solve 
it the right way. As a result, the only way you can come up with an optimized solution, in my opinion, is to have advanced
knowledge of the solution before hand given the short amount of time you have in the interview. While brute force solution 
is often obvious, optimized solution for a problem that I haven't seen before took me a day or two to figure out...
and you are expected to figure out and code it thoroughly in 20 minutes. So, unless you have done it before and remember 
it, you have no chance of passing the coding challenge. 

I have not done interviews for quite sometime and could not imagine how ridiculous the whole hiring process nowadays 
has become. This requirement means you need to not only know how to work on a problem, but you must also memorize 
the optimized solution so you can do it without a hiccup. 

In an experience I had with Samsung, I passed one round of coding challenge, the next interviewer challenged me
on coding as well. I get it done right in 10 min. Yet, The guy complaints my code is as clean as it could be and he 
suggested a cleaner solution way of coding it. You know what? The guy spent the next 30 min to do it himself (he did 
not remember well what he was asking me to do). In the end, he saved three lines of code, but he failed me anyway. 
Can you imagine how STUPID and CRUEL this whole coding challenge culture has become? What about my professional
experience that they were interested in the first place? Do they really care?

This is why many people have quietly given up on their career or dare not switching job for a better position or work 
environment.  I know quite a few of them personally. Thus, I suggest those who have similar experience as I do to 
say it out loud "CODING TEST SUCKS" and bring this issue to your congress men/women as this practice could potentially 
be used as a tool for discrimination, e.g. age, gender, race, etc. Not to mention, it puts some people in disadvantages, 
e.g. sensitive people who are not comfortable writing code with others over their shoulder or under pressure, people
who cant afford to devote lengthy training time due to family circumstance.

People of my generation were not trained to do this stupid thing to others. In the past, the purpose of an interview 
is to make sure the candidates have proper training and experience to do the job.  That's how we recruited people. 
I went through many startups of my own and others. I also worked for some big companies and, in the process, I hired 
many software engineers in my career. Yet, there was only once occasion when I requested a candidate to do a small
take-home project to make sure he has the right skills for the job.

Unfortunately, nowadays, many companies in the industry are blindly copied and incorporated this whole stupid 
coding challenge culture without thinking how it is going to effect someone else's career and life. Apparently,
they all hope that the coding challenge will help them to pick out people with the highest IQ. Yet, most likely, 
it will favor those who are just grasduating from school or can afford to go through the coding challenge training 
long enough to memorize it all. In the process, it also causes loss of income and unnecessary hardship for those who 
desparately need a job to feed their family. 

Dont agree with me? Google "coding challenge", you will find tons of so-called algorithm experts trying to cashing 
in on people who are looking for a software engineer job. 

Well, after this experience, I think I would better spend my time working on my own projects instead of wasting my
time going through this whole coding "ritual" process.  There are so many other interesting things that I want to 
spend my productive time on.

So, I am done with coding challenge. Period.


------  About the coding tests you found on this repo ------------------------

Most of the tests are from LEETCODE site. Just a few of them are from other websites. You
may find my comments in the code useful for helping you to follow the algorithms used for
solving these problems. Most interviews require you to solve problems with Easy-Medium 
difficulty problems due to limited time. Dont waste time on Hard problems. Those who want
you to do a Hard problem in a job interview are not worthy of working for anyway.

The below are some resources I used for for coding test training and practice while I was
at it.

- Algoexpert.io - provide video for explaining the algorithms behind every problem.
    You have to purchase access to their coding test problems and training video.
    The site focuses on coding test problems that they said most popular in interview.
    There is a video explaining how a problem is solved for every problem on their site.
    It is a good educational and training source. 

    The cost is $135.00/year which is significantly cheaper than LEETCODE ($35.00/month).

- leetcode.com - One of the most popular sites on coding tests that recommended by all big
    tech companies, e.g. facebook, google, etc.  The site has tons of coding tests listed,
    but it is mainly a site where people comes to hone their programming skillset and get
    familiar with coding tests.

    Most problems listed can be accessed with a free account. However, a paid account will
    allow you gain access to problems often used by big tech companies in their interview.
    The cost of a leetcode paid account is $35.00/mo. I recommend you to save your solutions some
    places else before discontinuing your subscription service since you will not be able 
    to access these problems after you end the subscription. I worked on many other problems when 
    I had the subscription, but unable to access them afterward for adding to this repo after I 
    ended the subscription.

- geekstogeeks.com - A good coding test solution resource is this website. You can find 
    solutions to almost any coding test problems on this website. The site also offers plenty 
    of articles on programming subjects that could be helpful in refreshing your skillsets.

- I found this course "50 popular coding interview problems" on udemy.com to be very helpful. 
  I got it for only $9.90 when it was on-sale. Maybe, you should get it for training. I dont
  think you need to spend more than that to feed the companies/people who are doing nothing
  productive but trying to get rich on this stupid coding challenge culture. 
  
I hope the collection of coding tests and solutions in the repo will be helpful to you in your job 
interviews.
