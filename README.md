# CODING TEST SUCKS!!!

This repo keeps track of solutions to coding challenge problems that I worked on for practice for over 2 months. A Facebook recruiter talked me into this effort as he knew that people in my generation are not well-prepared for coding challenge in light of a hiring manager interests in my professional experience. According to him, even a director position at Facebook requires to pass the coding challenge as the first step. These tests basically challenge a candidate on pattern recognition and algorithm. The hard part of a coding challenge is the pattern recognition part as it is not as obvious as algorithm and can wear many hats. That makes coding challenge tricky even to a professional engineer.

Despite of my 2-month+ effort to practice all these challenges on LEETCODE, etc. I only managed to remember a few of them.  The sheer number of coding challenges on LEETCODE simply overwhelmed me. There are thousands of them in existence and counting. New invention on coding challenge comes out every day with new trick to elude people of their chance of employment. Also, being an engineer, when facing with the challenges, I have the tendency of preferring to work on new problems in the list out of curiosity rather than sitting on the old ones so they can get into my memory system. So, after 2 months, working on nearly 200 of these problems, in the end, I realize I can hardly remember what I did during that self-training period. I think it would take at least a year of training to master all the techniques for recognizing patterns required for solving random challenges.

Worse, all companies make it a pass or fail criteria.  If you don’t make it through coding challenge successfully, there is no need for them to discuss about your past experience and accomplishment, which interests them in the first place.  As such, people who were graduating from school prior to 2010, like I am, may find coding tests as their “career killer”, as they were trained not to memorize, but to be able to perform research on demand and to innovate.

After going through this recruitment process, all I can say is "CODING TEST SUCKS" as it clearly favors the younger people who just graduates from school.  I think the coding challenge culture originally developed and applied by big tech companies for recruiting graduates from University, which makes complete sense, as students spend day-in and day-out to do tests or practice coding tests as part of their education. Also, they have no work experience for discussion in the interview.  Somehow, this recruitment technique is applied across the board for all levels of software engineers for whatever reasons.  It does not make any senses to challenge people who has a long line of experience in their career to with school stuff, a distant memory for most of them.

Today, most companies are requiring it as a measure of skills. Some even religiously believe coding test will help them sort out the best candidates, discounting all other qualities that make an engineer a good engineer such as experience, innovation, visionary, etc. Trust me, there would be no Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Eric Smidth, etc., if they were to face coding challenge for their job as of today requirement.

This idea is super stupid ... and believe it or not, most companies in the industry blindly copying it and applying as a key part of their recruitment policy. (Of course, no one in the industry wants to be any lesser than Google, Facebook, … including stupidity.)

Nevertheless, I did not pass the coding challenge at Facebook despite of 2-3 months self-training. My coding challenge with Facebook was only partially successful. (They asked two coding problems in 40 min, I can do only one of them, the other one I was able to figure out the solution, but not having enough time to finish it). To be fair, the recruiter gave me a second chance, but again, I can only manage the get it done partially, with brute force solution instead of optimized ones. 

A short time later, I got contacted by a Google recruiter, but again, the recruiter cant help but forcing me to go through the coding challenge, because it was the "company hiring policy", she explained. Being nice, I accepted the challenge, and again, I can only complete the challenge partially.

It is noted that they all expect candidates to perform the coding tests without a hiccup and with an optimized solution. Even if you come up with a solution, but not the optimized one or struggling to finish it, you failed. To be able to come up with an optimized solution, you must be able to deeply understand the problem in order to figure out how to solve it the right way. As a result, the only way you can come up with an optimized solution, in my opinion, is to have previously encountered the problem or similar one given the short amount of time you have in the interview. While brute force solution is often obvious, optimized solution for a problem that I haven't seen before could take me a day or two to figure out. And you are expected to figure out and code it thoroughly in 20 minutes. So, unless you have done it before and somehow remember it, you have no chance of passing the coding challenge.

I have not done interviews for quite sometimes and could not imagine how ridiculous the whole hiring process nowadays has become. (My last position was with Huawei Technologies R&D lab in Santa Clara since 2014 until Huawei decided to pull out of US in late 2019. After that, I worked on my own project, insircle.com). This requirement means that you need to not only know how to work on a problem, but you must also memorize the optimized solution so you can do it without a hiccup.

In an experience I had with Samsung, I passed one round of coding challenge, the next interviewer challenged me on coding as well. I get it done right in 10 min. Yet, The guy complained my code is not clean and he suggested a cleaner way of coding it. You know what? He spent the next 30 min doing it himself (he did not remember well what he was asking me to do). In the end, he saved three lines of code, but he failed me anyway. Can you imagine how STUPID and CRUEL this whole coding challenge culture has become????

To make the matter worse, you will most likely face coding challenge in every round of interview (usually, 3-4 rounds). It seems to me interviewers (software engineers themselves) do not have the time to prepare for interview these days, so, instead of preparing the interview with intelligent questions relating to the job opening, they have a tendency of throwing a couple of coding challenges and watch a candidate struggling to finish it and based their judgement solely on the result of the coding challenge that has nothing relating to a candidate's experience or the job requirements. 

Is it fair for a candidate to go through repetitive coding challenges again and again after they already passed it? This makes the interview process an exshautive process for the job applicants. I dont know about other people but I often spend several days to prepare for every round of interview as the possibility of encountering a coding challenge in the interview pretty high. Such process is just simply exceedingly ridiculous and a clear show of disrespect to a job applicant. Do I want to work for or with these kinds of people for long? Nope. Even if they offer me a job and I take it out of necessity, I would leave them as soon as a better opportunity arises. I stayed with Huawei technologies for 5 years until I was laid off for a reason. They respect engineers. Our software research lab organization never conducted coding challenge on any job applicants. Despite of this applicant-friendly practice, during the time I was with the organization, as far as I know, there was only one occasion where we hired a wrong contractor and we had to let him go after one month of trial.

Such exhaustive, unfair and abusive process is why many people have quietly given up on their career.  I know quite a few of them personally. Thus, I suggest those who have similar experience as I do to say it out loud "CODING TEST SUCKS" and bring this issue to your congress men/women or related government agency for changes. In another aspect, this practice could potentially be used as a tool for discrimination, e.g. age, gender, race, etc. All they have to do is to throw a hard coding challenge to a job applicant that they dislike for some reasons... and report the result. Not to mention, it puts many people in disadvantages, e.g. sensitive people who are not comfortable writing code with others over their shoulder or under pressure, those who can’t afford to go through coding challenge training (many in this category), etc.

People of my generation were not trained to do this stupid thing to others. In the past, the purpose of an interview is to make sure the candidates have proper training and experience to do the job.  That's how we recruited people. I went through many startups of my own and others. I also worked for some big companies and, in the process, I hired many software engineers throughout my career. Out of this, there was only once occasion when I requested a candidate to do a small take-home project to make sure he has the right skills for the job. If there is coding challenge in the interview, it is only to verify the candidate has coding skills to do the job with a straight-forward problem that anyone having proper schooling can do it.

Unfortunately, nowadays, many companies in the industry are blindly copying and incorporating this whole stupid coding challenge culture without thinking how it is going to affect someone else's career and life. Apparently, they all hope that the coding challenge will help them to pick out people with the highest IQ. Yet, most likely, it will get those who are just graduating from school or can afford to go through the coding challenge training long enough to memorize it all. In the process, it causes loss of income and unnecessary hardship for those who otherwise qualify for the job they are applying for.

Don’t agree with me? Google "coding challenge", you will find tons of so-called algorithm experts, coding test sites trying to cash in on people who are struggling with this stupid coding challenge culture.

Well, after this experience, I think I would better spend my time working on my own projects instead of wasting my time going through this whole aimless coding "ritual" called coding challenge.

So, in short, I am done with coding challenge.


------  About the coding challenges you found on this repo ------------------------

Until things change for the better, if you are looking for a software job, you may find my repo of coding challenges here useful. Most of the coding problems are from LEETCODE site. I worked on them and copied my solutions here, and adding the driver function (main) so I can play with them on any Linux machine. A few of them are from other websites (I dont keep track of them). You may find my comments in the code useful for helping you to follow the algorithms used for solving these problems. Most interviewers require you to solve problems with Easy-Medium difficulty problems due to limited time. Dont waste time on Hard problems. Those who want you to do a Hard problem in a job interview are not worthy of working for anyway. For LEETCODE problems, you can copy the solution body function of a problem to corresponding LEETCODE problem that I noted on top of the file and execute them on LEETCODE in order to study performance and memory usage of the solution.

The below are some resources I used for for coding test training and practice while I was at it.

- Algoexpert.io - provide video for explaining the algorithms behind every problem.
    You have to purchase access to their coding test problems and training video.
    The site focuses on coding test problems that they said most popular in interview.
    There is a video explaining how a problem is solved for every problem on their site.
    It is a good educational and training source. However, its test suite is insufficient,
    not thoroughly cover every corner case.

    The cost is $135.00/year which is significantly cheaper than LEETCODE ($35.00/month).

- leetcode.com - One of the most popular sites on coding tests that recommended by all big
    tech companies, e.g. facebook, google, etc.  The site has thousands of coding tests listed.
    It is  a site where people comes to hone their programming skillset and get familiar with 
    coding tests.

    Most problems listed on this site can be accessed with a free account. However, a paid account 
    allows you to gain access to problems often used by big tech companies in their interview.
    The cost of a leetcode paid account is $35.00/mo. I solved ~50 problems in this category when 
    I have the subscription, but cant make a copy of them here after I unsubscribed.

- geekstogeeks.com - A good coding test solution resource is this website. You can find 
    solutions to almost any coding test problems on this website. The site also offers plenty 
    of articles on programming subjects that could be helpful in refreshing your memory.

- I found this course "50 popular coding interview problems" on udemy.com to be very helpful. 
  I got it for only $9.90 when it was on-sale. Maybe, you should get it for training. I dont
  think you need to spend more than that to feed the companies/people who are doing nothing
  productive but trying to get rich on this stupid coding challenge culture. 
  
I hope the collection of coding tests and solutions in the repo will be helpful to you in your job 
interviews.

Happy coding!!!
