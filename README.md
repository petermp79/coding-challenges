# codingtests

This repo keeps track of solutions to coding challenge problems that I worked on for practice for over 2 months.
A Facebook recruiter talked me into this effort as he knew that people in my generation are not well-prepared for 
coding challenge despite of his hiring manager interests in my past professional experience. According to him, even 
a director position at Facebook requires coding challenge as the first step.

I know coding test sucks and favors people who just graduates from school, yet most companies are requiring it as a 
measure of skills nowadays. Some even religiously believe coding test will help them recruit the best candidates. 
People who were graduating from school prior to 2010, like I am, may find coding tests as their career killer, 
as they were trained not to memorize, but to be able to perform research on demand and to innovate. 

I think the coding challenge culture initially applied by big tech companies for recruiting students graduates 
from University, which I think makes complete sense as students spends day-in and day-out to do tests or practice 
coding tests as part of their education. Also, they have no work experience for discussing in the interview.
However, it does not make any senses to challenge people who has a long line of experience in the career to with
school stuff, which are a distant memory for these people. It is apparent that the hiring manager or whoever
has interests in an experienced professional is due to his/her experience. So, why not addressing their experience
in the interview? Why is it necessary to go through this unncessary "ritual" of coding challenge?

Despite of my 2-month effort to practice all these tests on LEETCODE, etc. I only managed to remember a few of them. 
I was just overwhelmed by the sheer number of coding challenges on LEETCODE. There are thousands of them in existence
and counting. There are new inventions on coding challenge every day with new tricks to elude people of their 
chance of employment. So, no matter how long you spend on training yourselves, it is only a matter of luck, not your
skills. 

Nevertheless, I did not pass the coding challenge at Facebook despite of 2-3 months self-training. My coding challenge 
with Facebook was only partially successful. (They asked two coding problems, I can do only one of them, the other
one I figure out the solution, but not having enough time to finish it). To be fair, the recruiter gave me a second
chance, but again, I can only manage the get it done partially, with brute force solution instead of optimized one.

A short time later, I got contacted by a Google recruiter, but again, the recruiter cant help but forcing me to go 
through the coding challenge, because it was the "company hiring policy", she explained. Being nice, I accepted the 
challenge, and again, I can only complete the challenge partially. 

It is noted that they all expect candidates to perform the coding tests without a hiccup and with an optimized solution. 
Even if you come up with a solution, but not the optimized one or struggling to finish it, you failed. To be able
to come up with an optimized solution, you must be able to deeply understand the problem and figure out the trick 
behind it. As a result, the only way you can come up with an optimized solution is to learn of the problem and solution
before hand given the short amount of time you have in the interview. While brute force solution is often obvious,
optimized solution often took me a day or two to figure out. And you are expected to figure out and code it in 
15 minutes. So, unless you have done it before and remember it, you have no chance of passing the coding challenge. 

I have not done interviews for quite sometime and could not imagine how ridiculous the whole hiring process nowadays 
has become. This requirement means you need to not only know how to work on a problem, but you must also memorize 
the optimized solution so you can do it without a hiccup. 

In an experience I had with Samsung, I passed one round of coding challenge, the next interviewer also challenges me
on coding, in which I get it done right in 10 min. The interviewer complains my code is not clean and he suggested
a solution that is cleaner. You know what? The guy spent the next 30 min to clean it up, as he did not remember well 
how to code the solution in a cleaner fashion either. The end result is saving three lines of code, but apparently,
he failed me anyway.  Can you imagine how STUPID and CRUEL this whole coding challenge culture has become???? 
Why cant they simply asking questions on technical skills that they need for the job????

This is why many people have quietly given up on their career or dare not switching job for a better position. 
I know quite a few of them. What I suggest those who have similar experience as I do is to say it out loud - 
"CODING TEST SUCKS" and bring this issue to your congress men/women as this practice is clearly age discrimination.
People of my generation were not trained to do this stupid thing to others. We were trained not to memorize, but
to be able to perform research and come up with innovative solutions.

Well, after this experience, I think I would better spend my time working on my projects instead of wasting my
time going through this whole frustrated experience.  

I am done with this stupid coding challenge. 
There are so many other interesting things that I want to spend my productive time on.


------  About the coding tests you found on this repo ------------------------

Most of the tests are from LEETCODE site. Just a few of them are from other websites. You
may find my comments in the code useful for helping you to follow the algorithms used for
solving these problems. Most interviews require you to solve problems with Easy-Medium 
difficulty problems due to limited time. Dont waste time on Hard problems. Those who want
you to do a Hard problem in a job interview are not worthy of working for anyway.

The below are some resources I used for for coding test training and practice while I was
at it.

- Algoexpert.io - provide video for explaining the algorithms behind every problem.
    You have to purchase access to their coding test problems and training video.
    The site focuses on coding test problems that they said most popular in interview.
    There is a video explaining how a problem is solved for every problem on their site.
    It is a good educational and training source. 

    The cost is $135.00/year which is significantly cheaper than LEETCODE ($35.00/month).

- leetcode.com - One of the most popular sites on coding tests that recommended by all big
    tech companies, e.g. facebook, google, etc.  The site has tons of coding tests listed,
    but it is mainly a site where people comes to hone their programming skillset and get
    familiar with coding tests.

    Most problems listed can be accessed with a free account. However, a paid account will
    allow you gain access to problems often used by big tech companies in their interview.
    The cost of a leetcode paid account is $35.00/mo. I recommend you to save your solutions some
    places else before discontinuing your subscription service since you will not be able 
    to access these problems after you end the subscription. I worked on many other problems when 
    I had the subscription, but unable to access them afterward for adding to this repo after I 
    ended the subscription.

- geekstogeeks.com - Another good coding test solution resource is this website. You can find 
    solutions to almost any coding test problems on this website. The site also offers plenty 
    of articles on programming subjects that could be helpful in refreshing your skillsets.

- I found this course "50 popular coding interview problems" on udemy.com to be very helpful. 
  I got it for only $9.90 when it was on-sale. Maybe, you should get it for training. I dont
  think you need to spend more than that to feed the companies/people who are doing nothing
  productive but trying to get rich on this stupid culture. 
  
I hope the collection of coding tests and solutions in the repo will be helpful to you in your job 
interviews.
