# CODING TEST SUCKS!!!

This repo keeps track of solutions to coding challenge problems that I worked on for practice for over 2 months. A Facebook recruiter talked me into this effort as he knew that people of my generation were not trained for this coding challenge culture. According to him, even a director position at Facebook requires passing the coding challenge as the first step. These tests basically challenge a candidate on pattern recognition and algorithm. The hard part of a coding challenge is the pattern recognition part as it is not as obvious as algorithm and can wear many hats. That makes coding challenge tricky even to a professional engineer.

------  About the coding challenges you found on this repo ------------------------

So, if you are looking for a software job these days, you may find my repo of coding challenges here useful. Most of the coding problems are from LEETCODE site. I worked on them and copied my solutions here, and adding the driver function (main) so I can play with them on any Linux machine. A few of them are from other websites (I dont keep track of them). You may find my comments in the code useful for helping you to follow the algorithms used for solving these problems. Most interviewers require you to solve problems with Easy-Medium difficulty problems due to limited time. Dont waste time on Hard problems. Those who want you to do a Hard problem in a job interview are not worthy of working for anyway. For LEETCODE problems, you can copy the solution body function of a problem to corresponding LEETCODE problem that I noted on top of the file and execute them on LEETCODE in order to study performance and memory usage of the solution.

The below are some resources I used for for coding test training and practice while I was at it.

- Algoexpert.io - provide video for explaining the algorithms behind every problem.
    You have to purchase access to their coding test problems and training video.
    The site focuses on coding test problems that they said most popular in interview.
    There is a video explaining how a problem is solved for every problem on their site.
    It is a good educational and training source. However, its test suite is insufficient,
    not thoroughly cover every corner case.

    The cost is $135.00/year which is significantly cheaper than LEETCODE ($35.00/month).

- leetcode.com - One of the most popular sites on coding tests that recommended by all big
    tech companies, e.g. facebook, google, etc.  The site has thousands of coding tests listed.
    It is  a site where people comes to hone their programming skillset and get familiar with 
    coding tests.

    Most problems listed on this site can be accessed with a free account. However, a paid account 
    allows you to gain access to problems often used by big tech companies in their interview.
    The cost of a leetcode paid account is $35.00/mo. I solved ~50 problems in this category when 
    I have the subscription, but cant make a copy of them here after I unsubscribed.

- geekstogeeks.com - A good coding test solution resource is this website. You can find 
    solutions to almost any coding test problems on this website. The site also offers plenty 
    of articles on programming subjects that could be helpful in refreshing your memory.

- I found this course "50 popular coding interview problems" on udemy.com to be very helpful. 
  I got it for only $9.90 when it was on-sale. It is the best resource for training and learning in
  my opinion.  
  
I hope the collection of coding tests and solutions in the repo and the information I provided above will be helpful to you in your job interviews.

Happy coding and best of luck!!!
