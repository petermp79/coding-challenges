# codingtests

This repo keeps track of solutions to coding challenge problems that I worked on for practice for over 2 months.
A Facebook recruiter talked me into this effort as he knew that people in my generation are not well-prepared for coding 
challenge despite of his interests in my past professional experience. According to him, even a director position 
at Facebook requires coding challenge as the first step.

I know coding test sucks and favors people who just graduates from school, but most companies are requiring it as a 
measure of skills nowadays. Some even religiously believe coding test will help them recruit the best candidates. 
People who were graduating from school prior to 2010, like I am, may find coding tests as their career killer, 
as they were trained not to memorize, but to be able to perform research on demand and to innovate. 

I think coding challenge culture initially applied by big tech companies for recruiting students graduates from University, 
which I think makes complete sense as students have spent day-in and day-out to do tests or practice coding tests as 
part of their education and as they often have a blank resume to begin with.

Yet, eventually, these companies apply it to every software candidate across the board, which I think is super-stupid. 
You bet, soon enough, every company in the industry just copy and make it as part of their hiring process.

So, you may ask, did I get a job from Facebook? 

The answer is NO. Despite of my 2-month effort to practice all these tests on LEETCODE, etc. I only managed to remember a 
few of them. I was just overwhelmed by the sheer number of coding challenges on LEETCODE (thousands of them). My coding 
challenge interview with Facebook was only partially successful.

A short time later, I got contacted by a Google recruiter, but again, the recruiter cant help but forcing me to go through 
the coding challenge, because it was the company policy, she explained. Being nice, I accepted the challenge, and again, 
I can only complete the challenge partially. 

It is noted that they all expect candidates to perform the coding tests without a hiccup and with an optimized solution. 
Even if you come up with a solution, but not the optimized one or struggling to finish it, you failed. I have not done 
interviews for quite sometime and could not imagine how ridiculous the whole hiring process nowadays has become. This 
requirement means you need to not only know how to work on a problem, but you must also memorize the optimized solution 
so you can do it without a hiccup. 

Given such requirements, the only way you can pass their challenge is to practice the coding tests regularly for a long 
period of time so they get engraved into your memory system. People in my generation were trained not to memorize, but 
being able to perform research and innovate, not to mention, coding challenge was never on the hiring agenda of our time.

Well, after realizing this, I think I would better spend my time working on my interests instead of recruiter's interest.

So, personally, I am done with coding challenge. I hope the collection of coding tests and solutions in the repo will be 
helpful to you in your job interviews.


------  About the coding tests you found on this repo ------------------------

Most of the tests are from LEETCODE site. Just a few of them are from other websites. You
may find my comments in the code useful for helping you to follow the algorithms used for
solving these problems. Most interviews require you to solve problems with Easy-Medium 
difficulty problems due to limited time. Dont waste time on Hard problems. Those who want
you to do a Hard problem in a job interview are not worthy of working for anyway.

The below are some resources I used for for coding test training and practice while I was
at it.

- Algoexpert.io - provide video for explaining the algorithms behind every problem.
    You have to purchase access to their coding test problems and training video.
    The site focuses on coding test problems that they said most popular in interview.
    There is a video explaining how a problem is solved for every problem on their site.
    It is a good educational and training source. 

    The cost is $135.00/year which is significantly cheaper than LEETCODE ($35.00/month).

- leetcode.com - One of the most popular sites on coding tests that recommended by all big
    tech companies, e.g. facebook, google, etc.  The site has tons of coding tests listed,
    but it is mainly a site where people comes to hone their programming skillset and get
    familiar with coding tests.

    Most problems listed can be accessed with a free account. However, a paid account will
    allow you gain access to problems often used by big tech companies in their interview.
    The cost of a leetcode paid account is $35.00/mo. I recommend you to save your solutions some
    places else before discontinuing your subscription service since you will not be able 
    to access these problems after you end the subscription. I worked on many other problems when 
    I had the subscription, but unable to access them afterward for adding to this repo after I 
    ended the subscription.

- geekstogeeks.com - Another good coding test solution resource is this website. You can find 
    solutions to almost any coding test problems on this website. The site also offers plenty 
    of articles on programming subjects that could be helpful in refreshing your skillsets.

- I found this course "50 popular coding interview problems" on udemy.com to be very helpful. 
  I got it for only $9.90 when it was on-sale. Maybe, you should get it for training.
  
... Happy coding!!!
