These directories contains coding tests. Most of them derived from the works I did 
on leetcode site as practice for my interviews where I document as best as I could to
make it easy for me to review the algorithm inuse later. I tend to forget problems I
worked on very fast. I was trained that way. Save my own memory for processing rather 
than memorizing. 

When applicable, in some tests, I also document different approaches with varying time 
and space complexities.

Some of the solutions are from other sites such as geekstogeeks.com.

All the tests are all C++ code. I plan to revisit these problems and do it in other languages
such as Javascript and Python to keep my language skills fresh.

To compile an individual test program, simply type:

> g++ -std=c++11 <test>.cpp -o <test>
