These directories contains coding test source files. Most of them derived from the works I did 
on leetcode site as practice for my interviews. where I tried to document as best as I could so I can remember
why I did what I did at a later time. I tend to forget problems I worked on very fast. I was trained 
that way. Save my own memory for processing rather than memorizing. 

When applicable, in some tests, I also document different approaches with varying time and space complexities.

Some of the solutions are from other sites such as geekstogeeks.com.

All the tests are all C++ code. I plan to revisit these problems and redo them in other languages such as Javascript 
and Python to keep my language skills fresh.

To compile an individual test program, simply type:

> g++ -std=c++11 <test>.cpp -o <test>
