These directories contains coding test source files. Most of them derived from the works I did 
on leetcode site as practice for my interviews. I tried to document as best as I could so I can remember
why I did what I did at a later time. 

When applicable, I also documented alternative approaches with varying time and space complexities.

Some of the solutions are from other sites such as geekstogeeks.com.

All the tests are written in C++ code. I plan to revisit these problems and redo them in other languages 
such as Go, Javascript and Python to brush up my programming language skills.

To compile an individual test program, simply type:

> g++ -std=c++11 program-file-name.cpp -o program-file-name
