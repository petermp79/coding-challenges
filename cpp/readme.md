These directories contains coding test source files. Most of them derived from the works I did 
on leetcode site as practice for my interviews. I tried to document as best as I could so I can remember
why I did what I did at a later time. I tend to forget problems I worked on very fast. I was trained 
that way. Save my own memory cells for processing rather than memorizing. 

When applicable, I also documented different approaches with varying time and space complexities.

Some of the solutions are from other sites such as geekstogeeks.com.

All the tests are written in C++ code. I plan to revisit these problems and redo them in other languages 
such as Javascript and Python to keep my language skills fresh.

To compile an individual test program, simply type:

> g++ -std=c++11 program-file-name.cpp -o program-file-name
